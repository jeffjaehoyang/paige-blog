I'm currently on the Program Team at SparkLabs, a startup accelerator in Seoul, focused on investment and global coordination. Before stepping into the venture industry, I worked for public relations agency Golin, lifestyle editorial Goop, and The Korea Herald. I graduated with a degree in journalism from Northwestern University in 2019.
