I'm currently working for a startup accelerator based in Seoul, South Korea, primarily focused on programming, investment, and global coordination. Previously, I worked for public relations agency Golin, lifestyle editorial Goop, and The Korea Herald. I graduated with a degree in journalism from Northwestern University in 2019!
